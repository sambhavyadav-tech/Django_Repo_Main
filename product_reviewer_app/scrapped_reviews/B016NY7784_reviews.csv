"Didn’t expect this from Amazon, their official seller Cloudtail is duping people and selling the product for higher than MRP! The Max Retail Price (MRP) is now 7600₹, and I just bought this on the Amazon Great Indian Sale. The price listed on Amazon is way over MRP at 8990₹ and seller Cloudtail (Amazons Official Seller) has quoted a 1991₹ discount (approx 22% discount) on the initial quote of 8990₹, hence I have only received a 600₹ or 8% discount only. Never expected Amazon to follow these shady tactics that other e-commerce sites follow. Quite ridiculous!Regarding the product it’s good but not great, rarely there is a slight lag time and sometimes it wouldn’t register. The charge time is blazingly fast! If plugged into the iPad for charging in about 15 seconds you get 30mins of usablity. And around 20mins overall to charge 100%. There is no on/off button and it shuts down or goes into sleep mode when the iPad is or when the Pencil is not in use so you don’t have to worry about it. An extra tip and a lighining adapter is given so you charge it directly via your charging cable and charge times are about the same. Overall feel is great but some kind of protection is needed as it can easily roll off a table. You can see the battery percentage, if it’s connected or charging via the batteries widget on your iPad. It’s connected via low energy Bluetooth and once plugged into the iPad it automatically connects and it is ready for use.Overall I have returned the product as it’s simply not worth the price, and to top that Amazon is selling it over and above the MRP and then saying it’s on a sale which isn’t right! But if you’re an artist I’d suggest you give it a try and see for yourself and try to get it during an ‘actual’ sale!

"I had bought this to go along with the ipad 2018, and I have been using the two for about a month now.Earlier I had the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, came with an s-pen stylus.It was good enough, and I used to take lecture notes on it for years.Now anybody who has ever used any samsung note model would know,that the s-pen is decent enough for most of your scribbling, doodling and note taking jobs...But it can't hold a candle to the apple pencil. The apple pencil simply blows it out of the water.Right off the bat, the lines are more precise, handwriting is vastly improved, drawing is a breeze, and note taking(even those including a lot of math) is just so much easier.And with dedicated note taking apps like goodnotes,and drawing apps like procreate;this is a worthwhile, no...a must have essential,for anyone who draws, sketches and takes notes digitally.",India,24-May-2020,bought go along ipad 2018 use two month nowearli samsung note 101 2014 edit came spen stylusit good enough use take lectur note yearsnow anybodi ever use samsung note model would knowthat spen decent enough scribbl doodl note take jobsbut cant hold candl appl pencil appl pencil simpli blow waterright bat line precis handwrit vastli improv draw breez note takingeven includ lot math much easierand dedic note take app like goodnotesand draw app like procreatethi worthwhil noa must essentialfor anyon draw sketch take note digit,0.9371,positive
"I bought the Apple Pencil for the iPad 9.7 6th Gen. And both the iPad and Apple Pencil has exceeded my expectations.Yes it's expensive but it's not overpriced. The quality is undoubtedly Apple. The performance is exceptionally well. As the name suggests, it's like holding a pencil. It's about the same size as a regular pencil, only heavier and cylindrical.Pros:1. Blazingly fast charging. About a minute of charging through iPad can give you about an hour of usage. The battery goes from 0% - 30% in 5 minutes. About 20 minutes for a full charge.2. It's very accurate and fast. The pressure sensitivity works really well.3. It's well balanced and feel natural in your hand. There is neat trick to it. If you put it on a flat surface it will always roll back to the Apple Pencil label on the chrome part.4. For all of the pros this one is the best. There is not much difference in performance whether you are using it with an iPad 6th Gen or iPad Pro (which is twice the price of iPad 6th Gen). The accuracy is similar to the point where you can't tell them apart. Sure there will be differences but they are not huge and will not affect your work.So if you are an artist on budget, both the iPad 6th Gen and Apple Pencil will not disappoint you!Cons:1. It's made of slippery hard plastic. Plus the rubber tip is smooth soft plastic. So there is not much friction to it while holding or drawing. I like the Wacom stylus on this front, it has a texture to it so it's much easier to hold.2. I wish it has the hexagonal shape instead of cylindrical just  like an real pencil. It would have been much easier to hold it then.Workaround for the less friction part:I bought a ₹10 pen with a rubber grip and applied the rubber on the pencil. All is well now. You can always opt out for a matte screen protector for the friction on the display.Overall it's a great product.

"My Apple Pencil stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase, showing battery is at 0%.Since then I am trying to charge it/ troubleshoot it. It is stuck at 0% (for more than 12 hrs).I contacted amazon customer support & they are giving me generic response like “replacement window is closed you need to invoke warranty”. Which could be a valid response if it has been a couple of month from purchase.With only 2weeks of purchase, my product has to go through a repair because amazon’s window is too short (to identify such issues) & have no policy to support customer’s interest beyond generic response.after bit or research i came across multiple such complains, So please beware of this product’s battery issue.

"NEVER BUY EXPENSIVE APPLE PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON !!!!!.I bought the Apple Pencil first generation on October first week , it worked perfectly for nearly a month and then stopped working at all.  Went to Apple service Center and they gave a biggest shock  saying that they cannot verify the purchase as the serial no in invoice was not matching and they would not accept my pencil. I can’t even return the product now.Talked to Amazon and they told they will resolve this issue in 3 days. It’s been nearly a week now and no response from Amazon till now.  Kind of feel cheated by Amazon and appario retail.My humble advice to future buyers : Always verify serial no in invoice with product .
