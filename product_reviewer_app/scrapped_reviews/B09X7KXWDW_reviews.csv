"This is my 1st ever Echo ü•∫ I'm amazed by its capabilities, however I still do not feel any necessities of it.""The more you want to be dependent, you become dependent""It's really an impulsive purchase üòÄ.

Love ‚ù§Ô∏è the design.2. Has a good weight.3. Sturdy built.4. Good bass for such a 1.6"" driver.5. Highs with just 0.8"" tweeter is adding unbelievable clarity to the sound.6.

"So it is my first Echo Dot.It definitely looks good. I like its spherical shape as compared to Ice hockey shape of last gen.Setting up hardly takes a minute.Sound quality is nothing impressive.Loudness is good enough but bass response is too low. Even lower than my 5watt JBL speaker which is definitely a let down. However bass can be increased but make sure with bass you also increase mids n high a bit so that the bass doesn't overpower the vocals n instruments.It is quite responsive in taking commands but at times it does not respond even if I shout and that too when the speaker is the same room as I am. It appears that it goes on sleep mode when not in use for quite a while. Not a deal breaker but it can be a nuisance clicking the mute or voice recognition button just to ""wake"" it up.Overall I am fine the product. As a new user, I do not mind it however I feel like bigger echo will definitely be the best if money is not an issue.But yes for an entry level smart speaker it is amazing n definitely worth the price.",India,5-December-2020,first echo dotit definit look good like spheric shape compar ice hockey shape last genset hardli take minutesound qualiti noth impressiveloud good enough bass respons low even lower 5watt jbl speaker definit let howev bass increas make sure bass also increas mid n high bit bass doesnt overpow vocal n instrumentsit quit respons take command time respond even shout speaker room appear goe sleep mode use quit deal breaker nuisanc click mute voic recognit button wake upoveral fine product new user mind howev feel like bigger echo definit best money issuebut ye entri level smart speaker amaz n definit worth price,0.991,positive
