The earphone is worth what you pay for. The design of the earbud may cause pain after prolonged usage. In that case basshead 103 is good.In terms of sound this is way more advanced than basshead 103. Bass is also increased.Quality wise i would preferred the nylone wrapping of even the two small cable would have been better.

"Please believe me, Volume of my phone automatically gets down when earphones are plugged in. Youtube play/pause, next/previous video buttons wont go away when earphones are plugged in. This is very annoying. I cant even watch a 5 mins video peacefully. I have to raise volume again and again. Mic quality is very normal. Boat is lying about the crystal clear sound. You can get the same voice quality in 100-150rs local earphones. My 450rs got totally wasted. I bought boat for the first time. Never buying boat again.

"I am not very keen of music listening, so can't comment how good music it produce. My purpose of using this is fully focused on call. It is doing a great work, more than expected. People on other side able to here me correctly. Sound produce by it is loud enough to here correctly. There is no noise cauae by this headphone.

"This product has caused me so much of damage that I had to write a review. Here is the thing. It is cheap and it works well with calls. I also wanted an alternative to in-ear buds that are available in the market. Hence, I bought it. Honestly, it has been a month and the earphone is working fine. However, I don't know what kind of a design boat is bragging of.  First of all using this earphone just for a few days has made my ears a little swollen. Also, it doesn't fit well. It will either fall off or it will hurt. If you lie down and use this expect it to fall off. If you sit down and use this expect it to give you some minor cuts. Why even buy this if you cannot use it properly? Volume buttons are not there. I thought I could do without it but the truth was later on I needed it. My suggestion is that if you want to buy a cheap product try out other brands in the same price range, buy the 50 rupee or 100 rupee one from small retailers or simply shell more money and get a better deal. Finally,  thank you boat for this terrible experience . I will never buy another product of yours (unless I have no choice) and will never compromise on quality over money.",India,5-September-2021,product caus much damag write review thing cheap work well call also want altern inear bud avail market henc bought honestli month earphon work fine howev dont know kind design boat brag first use earphon day made ear littl swollen also doesnt fit well either fall hurt lie use expect fall sit use expect give minor cut even buy cannot use properli volum button thought could without truth later need suggest want buy cheap product tri brand price rang buy 50 rupe 100 rupe one small retail simpli shell money get better deal final thank boat terribl experi never buy anoth product unless choic never compromis qualiti money,0.2308,positive
