"My review is a little bit long(sorry!) but I have shared my genuine experience after 7 days of use, it will help you decide whether you want to have these or not:Review [Day 3] (read review on last day of return below this):I loved these airdopes, tested it's batteries after 5 days of use, there doesn't seem to be any problem till now (as most of the reviews had problem related to charging and battery backup.)I am a casual user, music listener and video watcher, so for me it is simply the best.I previously encountered electrical interference in latest launched earbuds which is not at all present in these.Also, the feel of having these in ears is really soft, I used them throughout the day and they were great.Now, bass is quite down in these, also with 8 mm driver it is not that good with low frequency sounds. But it's just a minor loss nothing serious.At 999/- It can assure you BoAt service for a year and also great Battery backup.Earbuds : 5:30 hrCase : 5 times chargedNot 42 hours but around 30-32 hours overall.Not fit to enjoy gaming for hardcore gamers but great for casual gaming.ENC is present but I would say it is very light or rather negligible.Range is 5-7 m (with walls in between.)I charged it @ 10% battery first time, but will try to charge @ 30% or above from now to increase charging cycles. I was confused when to charge them, but apparently it's better to charge them as soon as you don't need them to have a good battery life, also avoid going below 10%.Right now with so many variants out there I believe if you do have a need of earbuds for normal use, these are the best.And one more thing don't forget to check whether the airdopes come to you with plastic sealed box or not. If they are not sealed in plastic then there is high chance of these being a returned product, which may or may not be as good as the one right out of the factory product.[Day 7 with some problems resolved]#Prob 1:The sound abruptly reduced, what I was getting earlier at 40% volume level now became 100% volume level.Prob #2:Also, the pair is not connecting as it should i.e. on opening the caseNow I am deciding to return the product as it is the last day, but suddenly I remembered: The Troubleshooting manual, and tried the following:Solution#:Unpair from the Bluetooth and pair again (even reset it if you want but first unpair it.)Do this 👆👆👆👆 and most probably the disconnecting one side bud or bad volume level will be reset and hopefully will become the same as when we received.Note: But there is this issue of it getting functioning faulty and that when I thoroughly took care of it, never dropped it, softly handled it, charged above 40% etc. So technically these airdopes are not perfected for long use, you may notice some misbehaviour from time to time, but most probably the problem can be reset. So do decide whether to purchase these or not knowing this!I hope it helps you, as I was finding this kind of review before purchase but there were none!This is purely based on my review after I was irritated with some ENC variants of Rs 1500-2000 range. Due to their ENC feature, I noticed electrical interference/buzzing noise.I am keeping it finally as it has at least no buzzing or irritating noise, comes from a known brand at a low budget.Update (After 3 months): This pair is still working fine. I have noticed the battery is not that better as it was initially but it is enough for 3-5 time charge (not from 0% but randomly after each use, generally from 30-50%). They will easily last you at least a day with the charging case in one charge. (Remember one day is the least, if you don't use it like crazy they can even last 2 days). I have noticed though for me using them for long does generate pain in ears (by long I mean for about 4-5 hours straight, I use them while studying to cutoff outside noises, which they perfectly do for me.) Hope it helps to share it's update over a period of use.

Aise bhi zindagi kharab ho rakhi Hain....aadmi thoda apna mood thik karne ke liye ganaa sunega par yahan toh yeh kaam hi nhi kar raha ...bahut bura lagta hain... frustration hoti hain...Boat ka sirf naam bada hain aur darshan chota hain..Ab batao what to do with these airdopes?

"Honestly what else can you ask for in a tws at  Rs.999? I am honestly perplexed to see a lot of people rating something like this 3 stars. It has a USB C port which charges at 5V 2A,it connects to bluetooth super fast and not to mention it comes with a 1 year boat warranty. What else do you even want? Noise cancellation? Game mode? At 999? Come on. The plastic top snaps super hard owing to the great magnets in this case, which is why the case top feels flimsy at times. At medium/low sound I only drained around 20% of the battery in 1 and a half hours of playing music from spotify. Obstructions distort the earphones though but that is to be expected with all earphones. Coming to sound, the fact that it even outputs sound which is audible is good enough for me.  Passive noise cancellation works super well if you are playing music and walking on the street. You won't be hearing a lot of traffic.
