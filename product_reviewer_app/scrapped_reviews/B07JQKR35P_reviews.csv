¬†Lots of request floating in @ What the WATT - Reviews for reviewing this entry level headphones from JBL.  We got this headphones from a colleague and thought its time to post a detailed review after a week of constant usage.We tried plenty of entry level cheap headphones, time and again realizing one thing - ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low prices are forgotten""Summary of review1. Specifications ‚Äì Mic and 1-button remote2. Reasons to buy  a. Great fit and multiple right sleeves for that perfect bass response  b. Amazing bass3. Reasons not to buy  a. Many options available if one can up the budget by 100 Rupees by JBL and other brandsDetailed reviewPackaging - The one startling thing you notice when receiving this product from amazon is what lies beneath that packaging of Amazon is a great package of JBL and JBL has not compromised on their values to provide great packaging and great sound. When you compare the same with Mi or boat its pretty evident that there is a significant compromise on the packaging in order to probably provide a good product, but the compromise in other product department is also clear when one starts discovering other aspects of say MI and boat (Rating 5/5)Design/Comfort ‚Äì When choice is of great sound - its also for great aesthetics, you probably don‚Äôt want to carry an awful product in your ear/body and only enjoy great music, isn‚Äôt it ! JBL does not disappoint in design even at this entry level wired headphone. The wire is long (sometimes feels too long) but after a use of 2-3 days we find it quite manageable. The twin cable is back but JBL has some special engineering design for this good old twin cable ‚Äì ‚ÄúHigh fidelity twin cable‚Äù (rating 3.5/5)Sound ‚Äì In a nutshell the audio is crisp and loud. This time I believe JBL got the voice of customer and packed a great sound in great price. The beauty of these headphones is you don‚Äôt have to screw those in your ear. One of the sleeve will fit perfectly to an Indian ear and that matters for experiencing the bass properly, a bad fit will certainly be not delivering experience of good bass. The shape of the headphone tube/canal is rightly angled ‚Äì honestly we have not seen such a good design, it‚Äôs a little way from typical JBL design but we welcome that change which reflects in sound positively. Low frequency ‚Äì 5/5, Mid/High Frequency ‚Äì 4.5/5 ‚Äì Voice clarity ‚Äì 4/5. Over all sound is a go from our side and we give these headphones 4.5/5 ratingDurability ‚Äì We ran an exhaustive test on these headphones especially on the electrical joints/abused them and these held on to the connections really long. Infact lifted a 2KG load with the cables to test strength and they did not break at all ‚Äì A specially designed test in our labsCall quality - Noise cancellation microphone is indeed a treat to the ears while on call and a one button remote is certainly value for money at the price. We give it 5/5 for the microphone and call quality. Remote is of great usage, smart one button remote in same microphone housing - wonderful (Single press - Mute/start music, Double click - Next song)Overall rating ‚Äì If you are looking for a budget good sounding product and value the brand you get associated with ‚Äì JBL C50HI is for you. We rate these 4/5 and not many entry level headphones get past 3.5 rating from our test lab and reviewers. So go for these headphones (pick any color from 3 available).Used it for almost 3 months now - Updating rating to 5/5 - Amazing durability",India,15-January-2019," media could loaded

"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been! The design of it is great especially because it helps in noise isolation when on call and fits perfectly (I got tiny ears :D). And the ear canal fit is amazing. Also one small trick one can do is to twist the buds after you fit in the canal (you can thank me later). I think it's great for the price you pay in comparison to all the other products within this price range + I got it during the sale. It also works great on my laptop.

"Sound quality is just ok but if cord touches any object, it humms in ear. That is worst enough to irritate you.
