And really had a great experience.Specs of the earphones are great, the micro woofers deliver you great sound quality and bass. And the noise cancellation is upto the mark.

"A quick honest review.Wanted a portable earphones alternate to my big headphones which sometimes gives pain to ears after constant use so thought of getting earphones as having earphones and headphones at same time is like getting better from both the world's.Design - red variant have killer color design.Sound- very nice even at lowest volume, you can still hear it nicely.Bass- justify at this price range.Treble- just equivalent to bass magnitude.What I felt is that in this earphones bass and treble goes hand by hand , none of the one has edge over other which makes it perfect for me. Both are complimentary to each other, perfectly match.What I didn't liked is in ear design, it pains sometimes, comes with different sizes of ear buds and rings too so you have to see which one fits perfectly.Overall at this price range it's worth it, definitely go for it.Edit: it's 24 September 2020, more than a year and it's still delivering music without any issues. Moreover I have purchased many earphones in between ,some in ear and some headphones, but this is still working while many have encountered issues. I have used this while riding bike under heavy rain so it's also immune to rain, mic wasn't very good from the beginning as it should not be for a calling purpose.

"The company says that it has subwoofers! They do not perform even close to what subwoofers are supposed to do. I had to increase the 60 Hz Freq response by +10 Db using an EQ to get enough bass that will give a flat sounding experience. For this price point, I have seen different earphones that perform really well in the low frequency range. The mids and highs are okayish and are suitable for watching videos and movies.About the build quality and form factor, they are well built, 3.5mm jack is angled and will last long.
