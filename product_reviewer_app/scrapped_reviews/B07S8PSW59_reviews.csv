This is my fourth purchase of boat earphones. I already had a boat 100 earphone. I will write down the pros and cons after eight months of using boat earphones.Pros:1. Good wire length.2. Fits in the ear.3. Sound quality is good.4. Bass is good.5. Easy for taking calls and speaking while working.6. Great for regular use.Cons:1. Musically it is moderately good. Treble is low.2. Absence of flat cables.3. Small ear beads.If it is used with care then it will last a good few years. The cable is regular wires given by nokia and other headphones.I am very happy with my purchase. Nice one for daily use by the general public who is not buying for musical use. Greatly recommended for everyday use. Extra beads are given matching ear type. Boat us a really genuine company with the given product range that it offers. Certainly go for it. I bought it at 399.

"I am a loyal boat fan. Having said that, I would like to share my review about this product within first 5 minutes of its use.The sound quality is awesome but still not as good as the hawk shaped variant. I opened up wynk playlist and it was a smooth experience. The bass effect is distinguishable. Loved the packaging shouting out 'Eargasm in the box'. The product lives up to it. It comes with a one year warranty which is a good deal, given the price point. I will update this review after one month of use. I hope it doesn't disappoint me.
