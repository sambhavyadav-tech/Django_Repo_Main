"IMPORTANT: Please ignore the rant that the Airdopes 141 is better than this. Well, it is not. This Airdopes 181 will be an absolute treat to your ears. There is zero distortion in sound with mids, highs and lows proper sounding. Boomy bass and crystal clear loud music. It also supports AAC codec which means HD quality music. Calling is good too.

"Honest Review: I'm a music lover, but seriously I was so disappointed with this earphone that I returned it within 24 hrs. The issue which I faced is the loudness of the airdopes, At full volume i wasn't getting that much of sound when I hear a wired boat earphones on same song. And second point would be ""Calling"", that is poor. And the touch sensor responses late take 2-3 seconds to respond for changing music or for pause/play. Better would be ""Realme Buds Air 2"", my brother uses that, i have used that airdopes and it's loudness is very good & calling is extremely good. But i found that bass is ok ok, but bass can be increased using Realme app, my bro said. The price is High upto 3k+, but it's worth.",India,16-January-2022,honest review im music lover serious disappoint earphon return within 24 hr issu face loud airdop full volum wasnt get much sound hear wire boat earphon song second point would call poor touch sensor respons late take 23 second respond chang music pauseplay better would realm bud air 2 brother use use airdop loud good call extrem good found bass ok ok bass increas use realm app bro said price high upto 3k worth,0.902,positive

"I would be mainly comparing it to Boat 141 Airdopes since I have both of them1) Connectivity Range is Excellent. It is double the range of 1412) Sound Volume is a bit lower than 141 but in my POV, it's good because guys, hearing at such high volume is really bad for your hearing3) The button is a bit up in the control stick & so, if you move the dope a little bit in your ear, the song is paused because of it which is really disturbing4) Overall good experience, since I bought it @ 1,199/- only During sale and 141 I had bought @ 1,399/-EDIT: After more than 10 days of usage, the Earbuds are not working properlyThey are not switched on even after taking out  of the case.
