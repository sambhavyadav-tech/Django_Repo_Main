"Budget earphone. Moderate ANC. Sounds a bit hollow in the name of soundstage.Biggest Drawback -You would expect double tapping on the buds will allow you to switch to the next /previous track. NO. It controls volume.Essentially you keep the most accessed feature handy,which is switching tracks or play/pause. But no, this earphone gives you volume control.

"The delivery was super fast .. however I found while using the earphones for 5 hours the experience was decent, the treble and bass is okayish. Definitely it is not for someone who is a gamer or loud music listener.  Good for calls and mic feature is decent at this price range, even the anc and ambient is decent. Quality is okay looks really nice. So for a budget earphones it is a good buy at 2k.P.s. you will experience a slight lag which isn't a good experience but for me it will do.

"Update: I got the replacement earbuds after raising complaint. The replacement buds don't have any issues. I would rate them 5 stars.Previous review: Rated 3 stars. I would have given these 5 stars if not for the audible clicks that are heard on only right earbud whenever you stop/start playing audio. It's really annoying and I'm not sure if all buds have this this issue or just the one that i got is faulty. Apart from this, everything else about these buds are good. The charging case and buds themselves are chic and comfy with premium touch. ANC is more than sufficient and exceeds expectations at this price range.
