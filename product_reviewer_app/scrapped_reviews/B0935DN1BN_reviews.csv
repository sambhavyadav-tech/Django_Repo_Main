So Basically the air tag is not a Solution for finding items which are beyond the range or perimeter of air tag and iphone.The item can be only located if it‚Äôs a near to a distance of 10-15 meters only.Also the beep sound is too low which can be only heard in complete silence.Can‚Äôt be used as A PET tracker at all.Also sometimes it won‚Äôt be able to located the air tag so you must be a closer distance within the Bluetooth of the air tag and your phone.Little pricy as well since apples are expensive than oranges.,India,28-May-2021,basic air tag solut find item beyond rang perimet air tag iphoneth item locat near distanc 1015 meter onlyalso beep sound low heard complet silencec use pet tracker allalso sometim wont abl locat air tag must closer distanc within bluetooth air tag phonelittl prici well sinc appl expens orang,-0.2411,negative

¬†Very easy to pair. Pull out the plastic battery separator and bring it near an iPhone. Seamless pairing within a minute. Bought from Appario.  Fast delivery by Amazon.NOTE: The precision tracking is not supported in iPhone SE 2nd gen.Not Suitable for pet tracking. Too big for wallets. It is good for keys and backpack/luggage tracking. If your iPhone does not support precision tracking, it is not work buying this now. Wait for the next model from Apple. Without precision tracking compatible phone, it does not have any everyday use, like finding your keys under a pile of things.This works with iPhone Find My network, i.e. it uses other iPhone with Find My enabled to track all AirTags. So if you are living in remote places it is difficult to track stolen devices. If you have an iPhone that support precision tracking it is useful to find things that you dropped while hiking / trekking  if you are within the range of the tag.",India,28-May-2021," media could loaded

"Does what it's supposed to. The metal gets immediately scratched and advertises it's an apple tag.

"I use this for my wallet as I am the most forgetful 38 year old man in the world. I have kept this in the change compartment of my wallet. It sits there cosy but the speaker is not loud enough, the coverage is not good enough and the performance of the app is very finnicky. I am leaving it with 4 stars as it has saved the day for me about 4-5 times. Instead of spending hours searching for my wallet, i have managed to find it. Total saved time approx 4-5 hours so far. I wish it was louder, I wish it had its own built in connection to EDGE/3g/wifi so it didnt depend on my iphone too much. good device just needs polishing.
