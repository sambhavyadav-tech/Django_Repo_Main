Hey you... you a budget buyer? good thing you're reading this review. I wanna say that this piece here gives you more that what you pay. if you use mi phone you can use the enhancer and add in extra bass. I used spotify equalizer and mi equalizer together and the bass was soo deep. the earphones handled it really well. also you can't hear anything else than the music. the design is just awesome. buy the red one. looks awesome. the quality is just right. right for the price. for this price I'd recommended this. I'm a bass lover. at first I was like ok. but then I'm satisfied now,India,7-August-2018,hey budget buyer good thing your read review wanna say piec give pay use mi phone use enhanc add extra bass use spotifi equal mi equal togeth bass soo deep earphon handl realli well also cant hear anyth els music design awesom buy red one look awesom qualiti right right price price id recommend im bass lover first like ok im satisfi,0.93,positive

I bought this earphone for my gym purpose and within one month it stopped working properly. Got it replaced and now the replaced one is working good untill now (just 1week passed) . I hope the replaced one would last long.Sound is nice. Bass is quite good compared to boat extra bass. You need to tweak equilizer to get excellent output. I own a Xiaomi phone so no issue for me.In short good output at this price but durability is a issue.,India,28-August-2018,bought earphon gym purpos within one month stop work properli got replac replac one work good until 1week pass hope replac one would last longsound nice bass quit good compar boat extra bass need tweak equil get excel output xiaomi phone issu mein short good output price durabl issu,0.7791,positive
