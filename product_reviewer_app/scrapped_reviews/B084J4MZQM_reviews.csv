Even boat stone speaker has better sound quality than this so called smart speaker.They said in description it's bass will be improved and with improved sound quality.But this is the worst sound I have ever listened on speaker.I have preordered this item in October assuming by its description it will be good than previous generations.Firstly they delivered i got defected product and it was not working at all as it was not connecting to wifi . then they said we will replace it and now i got my replacement order today and found out that sound quality is too poor and bass is too less. I want to return it but now amazon customer care saying you should have told this earlier but i got this product today only  and the defected product was not  my  mistake and they are not giving me refund and not accepting return.  how can i check sound quality on defected product which was not connecting to the wifi.

"I own Alexa 3rd Generation without clock, with clock and also alexa flex. My review is purely in comparison with other Alexa's and unless you have used them before you may not feel the difference.Sound quality: It's just fair compared to the 3rd Generation without clock model but is almost same as 3rd Generation with clock model. Lacks bass.Listening: Does not wake up when called in normal voice. Need to shout to wake it up. This is even bad when in between music. Same experience with 3rd generation echo dot with clock but 3rd generation without clock does not have this issue.Notification light: It's provided in the bottom of the device which gets hidden when placed on a high surface. Eg I have placed it above my TV and when I am on bed, I don't see the notification light unlike in 3rd generation where the light was at top.Clock: It has ambient light sensor and brightness adjusts accord to the room lighting. Same as 3rd gen with clock.Overall I dint experience any significant improvement from 3rd gen clock model. It appears like 3rd Gen in new look.

"""A friend in a need is a friend indeed"" Echo dot is just like a true, smart and intelligent friend. It's upto your training how well you tune it. It easily respond whenever you say ""Alexa"".PROS:1. Easy and smooth conversation.2. Volume can easily cover your living room, bedroom or office. I never set it to maximum (10). 7 or 8 is sufficient. Usually I set it to 6.3. While listening to music base is much balanced and sound is crystal clear. It is equipped with Amazon Music, Hungama music, Apple Music, Deezer, iHeartRadio, Pandora, SiriusXM, Spotify, Tidal, TuneIn, and Vevo.4. As far as intelligence and General Knowledge is concern, it is bang on. It will give you exact answers related to your GK questions. You my also add your own questions and answers in 'my question' section. I.e Alexa please tell me who is best YouTube? Answers: your own name. ðŸ˜€5. It connects diligently to different smart devices like Smart TV, AC, Smart switches, Smart Bulbs etc. No issues I found while I connected it with Smart devices at my home.6. It's LED light glows and indicates it's status quite well. Blue led indicates it is working fine. Yellow indicates it to be in setup mode and Red indicates that your device needs a troubleshoot.7. It's one of your best friend at your home. So enjoy It's company.CONS:1. The only con I found is incompatibilities with YouTube. It cannot connect with YouTube.Hope my review will help you buy this Smart Intelligent Friend. ðŸ¤Ÿ",India,27-November-2020,friend need friend inde echo dot like true smart intellig friend upto train well tune easili respond whenev say alexapros1 easi smooth conversation2 volum easili cover live room bedroom offic never set maximum 10 7 8 suffici usual set 63 listen music base much balanc sound crystal clear equip amazon music hungama music appl music deezer iheartradio pandora siriusxm spotifi tidal tunein vevo4 far intellig gener knowledg concern bang give exact answer relat gk question also add question answer question section ie alexa pleas tell best youtub answer name 5 connect dilig differ smart devic like smart tv ac smart switch smart bulb etc issu found connect smart devic home6 led light glow indic statu quit well blue led indic work fine yellow indic setup mode red indic devic need troubleshoot7 one best friend home enjoy companycons1 con found incompat youtub cannot connect youtubehop review help buy smart intellig friend ,0.9977,positive
