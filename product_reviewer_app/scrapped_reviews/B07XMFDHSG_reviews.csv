"I bought this Earphone as a replacement for my Boat Earphone. I mostly use earphones for listing to music and will use them as a headset for my Pubg mobile game which is why I needed the one with a mic.I found great reviews on realme 1 buds. so, I thought newer version will also do justice & at a decent price so wanted to try them out.I am comparing them with my Boat, (which speaker went out on one side but just came back).‚ö´ Sound Quality:The sound quality is actually very good! I'm impressed by crisp and clean sound with good bass! They are not headphones but for earbuds, they are top of my list even better than my boat which I thought were amazing.You get a nice bass at all volume levels and at higher levels the quality is still great and crisp/clear.‚ö´ Durability:I can't say too much since this is a day 2 review, I am going to try and come back in a month to do a follow up on how well they are!But initial thoughts it looks durable as it comes with high quality braided cable, Mic/Volume control/3.5mm Jack all feel solid and durable.We will see how long they last from daily use as an IT professional & part-time mobile gamer. (I will also update the stars for Durability is they prove me wrong).‚ö´ Noise Cancellation: Buds are very soft & comfortable & fit very well n isolate outside noise. And gives you the freedom to use in crowded places as well‚ö´ Cons:Normal 3.5mm jack (No angled jack)Cable above mic seems like average quality & frankly, I don't like upper side cable design‚ö´ Overall under 600, these Earphones sounds GREAT! I hope to return in the future to update my review using them for 30 days.",India,9-September-2020,bought earphon replac boat earphon mostli use earphon list music use headset pubg mobil game need one mici found great review realm 1 bud thought newer version also justic decent price want tri outi compar boat speaker went one side came back sound qualityth sound qualiti actual good im impress crisp clean sound good bass headphon earbud top list even better boat thought amazingy get nice bass volum level higher level qualiti still great crispclear durabilityi cant say much sinc day 2 review go tri come back month follow well arebut initi thought look durabl come high qualiti braid cabl micvolum control35mm jack feel solid durablew see long last daili use profession parttim mobil gamer also updat star durabl prove wrong nois cancel bud soft comfort fit well n isol outsid nois give freedom use crowd place well consnorm 35mm jack angl jackcabl mic seem like averag qualiti frankli dont like upper side cabl design overal 600 earphon sound great hope return futur updat review use 30 day,0.9969,positive

"I'm a diehard audiophile and have been using a lot of headphones. I dont usually buy expensive ones and mostly opt ones below 2k.Let me tell you, I fell in love with this buddy the very moment i put it in my ears. I was a JBL fanboy but lately there is a lot of quality issue with their products so I took a chance and bought this.In sub 1.5k range I can guarantee this is the best vfm product right now in the market.Pros:1. Build quality (is awesome)-Way better than JBL and Boat. Braided wire till splitter and earpiece ribbed wire is of good quality and feels durable.-You get magnetic tips too.-Mic clarity is good.-Buttons give a good feedback and feels premium.-Overall it gives premium feel. Didnt expect this much quality for Rs. 599.2. Sound QualityBass is just great, I mean GREAT and it does not muffle up mids and lows. Sounds more like JBL T110. Mid and low are also great. With proper equaliser setting, this guy will blow your audiophile brain.This is just soo good. Hope it will last long.
