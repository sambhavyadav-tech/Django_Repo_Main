"I am really impressed by Realme this time! I love earbuds and have several ones like Vido, Yincrow X6 and Monk Plus. These are quite well built and I love the audio output at this price point! The phone is able to drive them easily and pairing a DAC makes them even better sounding. The sound is U shaped, Bass is well presented but not basshead level and the bass quality will not disappoint you as it's good enough considering these are earbuds.

"Sorry for the confusing headline... actually... I meant to say if it fits well to your ear then it is the best that price can buy in this price range... if not then it is really horrifying..you will end up with pain in your ears.So before going into review further, what actually an audio device demands that is sound quality your primary question should be if it will fit to your ears or not..Luckily if you have such an 'fitting ears' the following portion is for you, otherwise abort reading here..Sound Quality:Overall great. This has got the largest driver size (14.2mm) that I never encountered in any bud. By virtue of that it delivers beautiful, clear sound across all ranges, high & mid are excellent and crisp; low is also good (if it fit properly to your ears)rating:High (treble): 9/10Mid: 9.5/10Low (Bass): 7/10Microphone:as demanded in the spec, quality is excellent, crystal clear (for 4G calls) but its positioning one the wire is quite weird, its so distant from your mouth, almost 8-10 inches away for an average person (without exceptional neck length like crane or giraffe ;)!), it will invariably pick your voice only feebly. You have to hold it near your mouth for better voice volume to reach at other end. Couldn't find any justification placing so distant!!Rating: 8/10(would have given 10/10 if it was closer to mouth)Build Quality:overall good. Wires are decent and seems to be durable, but the buds itself are plasticy and slippery and quite often fall from your ears. the jack would have been better if featured right angle type.Rating: 6/10Fit:this is the most horrible part. as the buds are hard there is no scope to adjustment as par the shape of your ear (unlike 'in the ear' gel buds type) as the buds are plasticy it will not seat at its position, will slip readily. Cant be used during heavy movements (not even for brisk walking). and it pains on prolonged usage.Rating: 3-4/10However, I liked the common problem of 'in the ear' gel buds type- the unnatural own voice resonance (just like that you feel when you talk closing your own ear) while speaking due to sound conduction is not so much here.Final Verdict:If you have a chance try it first whether it fits to your ears (need a large ear type) before you decide to get ones!!It actually sound great!!",India,28-August-2020,sorri confus headlin actual meant say fit well ear best price buy price rang realli horrifyingy end pain earsso go review actual audio devic demand sound qualiti primari question fit ear notluckili fit ear follow portion otherwis abort read heresound qualityoveral great got largest driver size 142mm never encount bud virtu deliv beauti clear sound across rang high mid excel crisp low also good fit properli earsratinghigh trebl 910mid 9510low bass 710microphonea demand spec qualiti excel crystal clear 4g call posit one wire quit weird distant mouth almost 810 inch away averag person without except neck length like crane giraff invari pick voic feebli hold near mouth better voic volum reach end couldnt find justif place distantr 810would given 1010 closer mouthbuild qualityoveral good wire decent seem durabl bud plastici slipperi quit often fall ear jack would better featur right angl typer 610fitthi horribl part bud hard scope adjust par shape ear unlik ear gel bud type bud plastici seat posit slip readili cant use heavi movement even brisk walk pain prolong usager 3410howev like common problem ear gel bud type unnatur voic reson like feel talk close ear speak due sound conduct much herefin verdictif chanc tri first whether fit ear need larg ear type decid get onesit actual sound great,0.9812,positive
