"Understands almost everything in english and Hindi. For many things you need to activate additional apps in alexa app. I had a echo 2nd generation earlier, and choose dot for its compact size.Pros: 1. It has room filing sound, i never have to use the max volume except when i am playing songs. The bass in not much, the app should have music equalizers. This is expected from front firing speakers.2.

 My first smart speaker . :D beautiful lighting. And the speaker sound even at 50% is more than enough for a room. And 100% the whole house will feel it. I highly recommend the led display. It adjusts according to the room light. It pairs with my firestick(with my non-smart Sony TV) and smart bulb.",India,12-November-2020," media could loaded

"I am not sure why people are writing bad reviews about this product - may be they are talking about a different device :-) or perhaps my own needs are different. I would like to share my views, nonetheless.My experience with this device has been great so far. It is cute to look at, takes up limited amount of space, sounds great, and has completely eliminated my need to google my day to day searches. I had bought a Portronics blue tooth speaker sometime back, but for all such devices to work, you need to have your laptop/desktop to be consistently online, while Echo Dot works independently, without any reliance to an externa device. Yes, one caveat is that you should have a good, consistent and strong WiFi connection available at all times. Is that too much to ask?I am using Alexa to set up reminders and alarms, querying my regular internet searches, playing my favorite songs, reading my Audible books, and even calling and chatting with friends. I am yet to use it's smart home features, so I cannot comment on those, at the moment.The sound from the speaker is superb, for it's size. For most purposes, fifty percent volume is enough for me to listen to all my favorite songs - it's THAT good. If you are looking for a Bose-like sound experience from such a small device, then you will be highly disappointed. So please keep your expectations reasonable.The voice recognition is instant and sensitive. I have commanded Alexa from two rooms away and she still heard me. The clock in the front is the highlight feature and I love it. If you consider buying the Echo Dot, do not buy it without the clock, in my opinion. It looks wonderful. I wish Amazon would put this feature on all its Echo devices.In short, I am very happy with my purchase and I have not even begun to utilize everything that Alexa can do. Think of it as your digital companion, especially during these Work-From-Home days. How you want to use it, is up to you.Everything in the world in not about cost, and Echo Dot is NOT just a Bluetooth speaker. If you are just looking for a Bluetooth speaker, please look elsewhere. If you looking for a digital experience that enhances your productivity and ambience, go for it, without a shred of doubt. Remember, however, that there is a learning curve and you need to teach yourself on how to get the best out of this device.",India,9-November-2020,sure peopl write bad review product may talk differ devic perhap need differ would like share view nonethelessmi experi devic great far cute look take limit amount space sound great complet elimin need googl day day search bought portron blue tooth speaker sometim back devic work need laptopdesktop consist onlin echo dot work independ without relianc externa devic ye one caveat good consist strong wifi connect avail time much aski use alexa set remind alarm queri regular internet search play favorit song read audibl book even call chat friend yet use smart home featur cannot comment momentth sound speaker superb size purpos fifti percent volum enough listen favorit song good look boselik sound experi small devic highli disappoint pleas keep expect reasonableth voic recognit instant sensit command alexa two room away still heard clock front highlight featur love consid buy echo dot buy without clock opinion look wonder wish amazon would put featur echo devicesin short happi purchas even begun util everyth alexa think digit companion especi workfromhom day want use youeveryth world cost echo dot bluetooth speaker look bluetooth speaker pleas look elsewher look digit experi enhanc product ambienc go without shred doubt rememb howev learn curv need teach get best devic,0.9976,positive

"I have been working from home from past one and half year. Handling your work pressure and not going out due to lockdown has caused depression and frustration. You cannot leave your desk and go out during working hours.

Installing Eco dot is very easy , we need to download Alexa app from Google store and then connect it with your Wi-Fi and that's it, your Alexa is ready.3. The built quality is awesome and i went for the blue color and it look's awesome.4. The bright digital clock is an icing on a cake, the clock looks attractive and the brightness of the clock adjusts automatically as per the lighting in the room.5. The speaker quality is excellent and even the volume level at 3 is pretty good when i am working at my desk and volume 05 is louder enough for my room.6. I have connected my LG soundbar and also tried connecting speakers with the audio out , in both conditions it worked excellent.7. The mic quality is awesome as Alexa picks up the voice from pretty long distance.8. I have not tried with connecting to the smart bulb or any other smart equipment, so no comments.9. Its helping me in getting reminders, setting alarm is very easy and playing songs while working is the best part.If you are looking for an interactive entertainment on your work from home desk with an attractive digital clock, then you must try buying it.Overall an awesome product and i am still exploring it and will come up with an second review very soon.5 star product and a 5 star rating.",India,31-July-2021,work home past one half year handl work pressur go due lockdown caus depress frustrat cannot leav desk go work hour search solut alexa came picture1th product deliv time pack excel condit product damag transit2 instal eco dot easi need download alexa app googl store connect wifi that alexa ready3 built qualiti awesom went blue color look awesome4 bright digit clock ice cake clock look attract bright clock adjust automat per light room5 speaker qualiti excel even volum level 3 pretti good work desk volum 05 louder enough room6 connect lg soundbar also tri connect speaker audio condit work excellent7 mic qualiti awesom alexa pick voic pretti long distance8 tri connect smart bulb smart equip comments9 help get remind set alarm easi play song work best partif look interact entertain work home desk attract digit clock must tri buy itoveral awesom product still explor come second review soon5 star product 5 star rate,0.9947,positive
