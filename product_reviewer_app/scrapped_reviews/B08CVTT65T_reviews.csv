This is the second time I am writing this review. Not sure why my earlier detailed review which was more like a ownership review was deleted by Amazon. Hope this review is published and not eventually deleted however this review would not be as detailed as the previous one. Purchased this product in Aug 2020 and since then had 3 replacements from Boat within a year. Each unit would last 3 to 4 months max depending upon the usage and always one or the other earpiece would die out. The left earpiece of the 3rd replacement died out 2 days back. Please note I have mostly used them during my morning jogging/running. Over all the sound quality is good and enjoy them as long as they last but the overall durability of the device is very very poor.

"I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.3. Select Feat. JBL E1+4. Open Preset options5. Select Blues and Voila!! ðŸŽ¯For other phones -I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! ðŸ™‚Happy Listening! ðŸŽ¶",India,21-February-2020,research get nice tw bud everyday usemi prioriti like 1 balanc sound nice blend bass trebl midsim audiophil readi compromis cuz budget p2 type c charg use oneplu 6t much conveni manag thing one charger3 decent batteri backup4 shoudnt feel bulki earsand got bud goe feedback 1 first impress look great love red black color tone2 fit well ear without feel bulky3 super satisfi audio qualiti felt bass heavyfound fix equalis settings4 there volum control option bud phone without much effortaint itfix adjust bass your oneplu devic 1 fortun oneplu provid audio tuner adjust eq os level2 open audio tuner go sound enhancement3 select feat jbl e14 open preset options5 select blue voila phone im sure devic havent test coupl thing use previou phone adjust sound set phone music player app provid equalis set select preset like vocaljazzbluespop tend compress bass enhanc mid treblealso read coupl review tw bud consid chang ear tip smaller one surprisingli boost experi howev mostli depend size ear might work everyonedo let know need inform happi help happi listen ,0.9882,positive

"Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.Pros:1. Great Sound Quality2. Great Bass3. Great Battery Life4. Fast ChargingCons:1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.",India,9-August-2020,boat indian compani product compani made china make product buy chines product sell namei extens use bud month workout watch movi listen music detail review earbudspros1 great sound quality2 great bass3 great batteri life4 fast chargingcons1 doesnt fit properli ear 3 friend mine face issu doesnt fit properli special right ear also right ear start pain sometim push tri fit properli rotat ear2 right bud doesnt fit properli obvious dont feel good sound qualiti right ear bud sometim felt problem right earbud sound qualiti realis fit issue3 earbud slip ear wear work due sweat get slip get wet due sweat even earbud fit properli fall get wet4 compani say soon open charg box bud bud get pair automat sometim doesnt get pair left right one get pair phone laptop wait sometim get paired5 rang bluetooth great sometim even rang boundari level within rang one bud stop work hear sound one bud time right6 sometim one earbud stop work without reason batteri statu bud differ weird7 right earbud stop work month find servic centr everywher good8 last certainli least sale servic horribl custom care doesnt respond call email twitter anyth pain reach behav like roadsid local shopso good pair earbud rs2500 much earbud would suggest buy pair earbud pricey buy nois shot nois shot xo much better enjoy experi themboat horribl ridicul,0.6902,positive
"The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive. Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud.

"I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441.  Also, the sound quality is best.
