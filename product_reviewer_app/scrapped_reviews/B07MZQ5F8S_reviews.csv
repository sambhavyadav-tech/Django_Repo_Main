The sound quality is surprisingly amazing.. never expected such fantastic performance from such cheap earphones. Phillips is a trusted choice when it comes to earphones and music systems. However the thin wires don't seem to be much reliable for rugged usage.P.S. to avoid disconnection of wiring from earpieces due to unintentional stretching just put a small knot (semi tight) just short of all d three ends which can absorb the shocks ib themselves.

"Best earphones in the price under 400. Before this i had order boat 225 earphone which was costly and worst earphone cause it was itchy and paining in the ears so i returned it.

Made in china mention on the microphone and it proves again that why the chinese manufactured products are good.Not for those who are looking for higher bass quality sound.Simple made earphone,  build quality is very lighty which i like it.
