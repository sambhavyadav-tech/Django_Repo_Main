"Better than previous models , except battery",India,18-November-2020,better previou model except batteri,0.4404,positive
"Power packed device in hand. Did lot of research before buying this over 12 pro or 12. Upgraded from 6s 16GB, what a relief. Kept the old device with me as second phone. Skipped amazon this time (for first time) to grab in store HDFC discount. Camera is super awesome. Went for 128GB as 16 GB made me really struggle last 1 year, I have 200 tv cloud also. Plan to keep this one for 5 years at least as the case was with 6s.Form factor was important for me, as I can’t pocket a phone bigger than this. Smaller than 6s and little (1.5 times) thicker. Blue isn’t that bad as some reviews said. It’s good. Make the 12 standout in this colour, as soon as you pocket out the phone.It’s a power horse, won’t regret.Now the battery, I don’t play games, but I use a few apps social media etc for 2-3 hours a day and have to attend a few long phone call and general office battery charged at 100% at 8am, 85% by 10 pm, 45% by 2PM and 15% by 9PM. If it could have pulled 2-3 hours more, it would be more fine. But I am one of those people, who don’t watch videos, don’t play music, don’t play games. I use phone most of the time for productivity, finance payment, messaging apps and news reading apps. So battery is a issue. And it’s a size vs battery battle. I think I will have to go for battery replacement after 2 years once the battery charging drops to 88%. It’s a difficult call. Go for it only if form factor matters more for you. If you can handle 12, go for it.UPDATE: After 10 days of use. Camera is really good. However, battery lasts from 8AM and dies at 6PM. I am regretting why I bought this phone and already called store to buy normal IPhone or Pro with bigger battery.UPDATE: After 30 days of use. The trade in value was about 60% so I continued with mini. The amazon offers are now better than store ones. I am also restricting to 6 hrs of screen time and it’s doing fine.UPDATE: After 250 days of Use. Battery health 90%. Screen time 6.5 Hr everyday. Fast charge is must buy with this.

"Upgraded from iPhone 7. This really is a significant upgrade. I love this size. This is just perfect, you can use it single handedly, easily fits into pockets, reach every corner of the screen easily.I was waiting for this size for so long and finally, after 2 months of buying, I’m writing a review. Just go for it if you want a small phone. In reality, it’s not even that small, almost the size of iPhone 7, with full edge to edge display.Feel: Ever used an iPhone 5 (or 4, 5s, SE)? Remember how boxy it was and how good it felt in your hand, with all those edges? Same with this phone. It feels so good to hold in hand with a glass body, it cannot be expressed in words.Display: Phenomenal! OLED display with HDR stuff feels like on a different level. Darks feel dark, and not grays.Sound: Stereo speakers, which really are loud and clear. iPhone 7 also had stereo speakers but on these, there’s a noticeable difference in loudness, and sound quality.Battery: Many people are criticizing battery, but I’m not a heavy user, most importantly I’ve been an iPhone user so battery life is decent enough. Much better than iPhone 7, obviously. Easily lasts more than a day. And with a 20w charger, it charges pretty fast too.Security: Upgrading from TouchID to FaceID was a nice experience. I’m already in love with FaceID. It works every single time (except when you’re wearing masks, you have to put it down a little bit to let it recognize your face).Camera: I don’t need to describe this. Do I? But let me tell you the night mode is superb!Accessories: You only get a Type-C to lightening port cable, and a single apple sticker. That’s it.eSIM functionality works great, WiFi reception is good, call quality is awesome, as you’d expect. Long story cut short, everything is great when compared with iPhone 7 (which still was working awesome, except storage, and battery after 3 years). The only thing I miss is 3D Touch, and home button, lol.To conclude, it’s a great buy. I bought 128GB version in black color.

"All in all good phone those who loves compact phones. I have identified few things those who complain about battery life. Try these to improve battery life,1) try mobile data, bluetooth when not needed. With these two being on, I noticed considerable battery drain.2) when you are in remote places, try put it in airplane mode. This keeps phone searching for the network all the time and drains battery.3) hey Siri, please turn off yourself. I don't use it anymore.
