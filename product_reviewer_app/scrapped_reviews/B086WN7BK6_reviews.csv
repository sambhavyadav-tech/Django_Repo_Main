"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone.

I've been using soundmagic e10c sennheiser hd 202  & many more in that category & I recently bought ant audio w56 & these boats 152 at the same time when both were 499 & trust me ant w56 are lot better than this ! These distorts  at 80+ levels  & are bit kinda muddy.Like they are fine for 500 bucks but if you want absolute bang for your money then go for ant audio w56 cause yeah 500 bucks matter when that's the only budget where you expect something exceptional.Sound- 7.5Build quality-8.5  (It's half braided cable upto mic  cause fully braided cables tends to disturb call connectivity ) A good thing boats did.Value for money-8Boat bassheads 225< Bassheads 152 < Ant Audio W56,India,11-February-2019,ive use soundmag e10c sennheis hd 202 mani categori recent bought ant audio w56 boat 152 time 499 trust ant w56 lot better distort 80 level bit kinda muddylik fine 500 buck want absolut bang money go ant audio w56 caus yeah 500 buck matter that budget expect someth exceptionalsound 75build quality85 half braid cabl upto mic caus fulli braid cabl tend disturb call connect good thing boat didvalu money8boat basshead 225 basshead 152 ant audio w56,0.7777,positive

Update: The rubbery portion of the wire is really flimsy and has worn out and got cut in placess inspite of being handled properly. Updating my rating of this headphones from 5 to 2. The braided cable was what this product was advertised for showing off its durability but the entire piece is not braided and as anticipated that was the point of failure. Skip this go for something sturdier.Old Review:Just received the item. Got 2 pair of extra earphone plugs in pack.Tested audio at 60% volume which was pretty loud.Pros -1. Metallic Blue colour looks great2. Braided cable from pin to the mic3. Clean audio output and quite loud4. Bass is not too overwhelming - Just right for hiphop / EDM / bollywood / rock - tested with Badshah's / Maroon 5 / Clean Bandit / Michael Jackson  songs (over time i have seen these songs are the ones which can show how good your speakers are). Treble is not too bright  and sounds just right.5. Tested with old Kishore songs and the output sounded very nice and full (non processed)6. Tested with only instrumentals like Kenny Boney James - Sounded great as if played from an amplifier with subs.Cons -1. The braided cable color combination could look better with blue and black2. The portion from the mic to the earphones if also braided would enhance the otherwise good build3. Price i bought it for is 499/- however a price of 399/- would be more appropriate for this item4. A pouch or a small carry case would be a great addon to this if at a price of 499/-I feel most people complaining about their branded headphones failing sooner than expected is because of using them on PCs and playing audio/video using applications like VLC which have audio amplifiers which burn the speaker coil over extended use. Suggest using other players and avoiding any sound enhancers etc on phones or PCsNOTE: I am not comparing with the likes of Sennheiser \ Audiotechnica \ JVC \ JBL \ Bose \ BeatsAudio \ Sony - all of these brands are pretty good when it comes to audio signatures and separation but they also come at a much more premium cost.,India,12-April-2019,updat rubberi portion wire realli flimsi worn got cut placess inspit handl properli updat rate headphon 5 2 braid cabl product advertis show durabl entir piec braid anticip point failur skip go someth sturdierold reviewjust receiv item got 2 pair extra earphon plug packtest audio 60 volum pretti loudpro 1 metal blue colour look great2 braid cabl pin mic3 clean audio output quit loud4 bass overwhelm right hiphop edm bollywood rock test badshah maroon 5 clean bandit michael jackson song time seen song one show good speaker trebl bright sound right5 test old kishor song output sound nice full non processed6 test instrument like kenni boney jame sound great play amplifi subscon 1 braid cabl color combin could look better blue black2 portion mic earphon also braid would enhanc otherwis good build3 price bought 499 howev price 399 would appropri item4 pouch small carri case would great addon price 499i feel peopl complain brand headphon fail sooner expect use pc play audiovideo use applic like vlc audio amplifi burn speaker coil extend use suggest use player avoid sound enhanc etc phone pcsnote compar like sennheis audiotechnica jvc jbl bose beatsaudio soni brand pretti good come audio signatur separ also come much premium cost,0.9928,positive
