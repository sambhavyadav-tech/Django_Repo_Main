"The quality is not upto the mark. The Earpods which come with the New iPhone - Cable is Soft and is very subtle when felt by hand, on the other hand, however close the Manufacturer has tried to copy it, but havent used the same grade material - the Earpod Cable feels hard and the plastic of earpods is also not good. This product has gone bad already within a month. I cannot use it. A waste of Rs. 2,000 for me.
