"I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs...

"This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range.

I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer,India,15-June-2019,bought earphon caus read review provid excel sale servic replac earphon defect occur previous tri mani compani earphon month alway would give problem sound qualiti durabl amaz price due rough usag one ear stop work 3 month sale servic amaz arrang pickup old earphon deliv new pair 10 daysreal happi custom,0.9217,positive
