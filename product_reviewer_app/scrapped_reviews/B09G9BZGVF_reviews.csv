"Why the hell there is so difference between 13 and 13 Pro? Like 13 (128gb) costs 80k and 13 Pro (128gb) directly costs 1.20L? There actually no major difference between them except the refresh rate, so for that you'll charging 40k extra? First of all after so so so long you'll upgrading your refresh rate from 60 to 90, infact there are phone's having 144 too, but you'll not letting normal people use 90 refresh rate, giving a price difference of 40k? Do you know how much that is for a common man? A person gives is years of saving to buy iPhone, and you'll charge 40k extra for just a refresh rate?

I didn't find any improvement over iPhone 12 pro. Rather clicking pic at portrait mode in 3x is a bigger headache as you can't pan the zoom and 3x is too tight for indoor photography.

"Apple provides the class as we all know. This one got good display , screen quality , processor and camera . I was expecting much more from battery part as i play games heavily and i am not very happy but just satisfied that apple can try to create better battery life .Only buy if you want to but not if you expect everything to be great .Edit : This phone heats up after 30-40 mins of heavy gaming like COD or MC5",India,3-December-2021,appl provid class know one got good display screen qualiti processor camera expect much batteri part play game heavili happi satisfi appl tri creat better batteri life buy want expect everyth great edit phone heat 3040 min heavi game like cod mc5,0.9686,positive

"I have been Google pixel fan and have been Android user since last 8 years. I was looking for change and decided to buy iphone 13 pro silver. 256 GB is perfect storage we can go for.

"Apple has turned pro this time and itâ€™s my first pro purchase ever. 120hz feels insane and the cameras are out of this world. No camera can match apple as it leaves everything in the dust. The way I see photography is the simplicity. You should just be able to take out your phone , open the camera and click your best shot. Not depend on artificial 100X useless zoom or 108 megapixels, they donâ€™t count at all. Sierra blue color is absolutely stunning!!!!

"Nice buy. Very costly, but high end built and premium feel. Addictive like other previous iPhone models.Excellent triple camera with LiDar. Face unlock works with spectacles and mask on.Battery lasts roughly one day. Fast charger (bought separately) charges battery to 100% in approximately 1.5 hours. Touch is super smooth- better than iphone 12, 11 & SE. Screen is also way way better than previous iphone models.Highly secure and has many useful features like OCR (text) from photos being one of them.Pricing is very high (almost double of that of iPhone 13), probably due to being completely imported.Overall a good phone if you have the budget for it.",India,18-December-2021,nice buy costli high end built premium feel addict like previou iphon modelsexcel tripl camera lidar face unlock work spectacl mask onbatteri last roughli one day fast charger bought separ charg batteri 100 approxim 15 hour touch super smooth better iphon 12 11 se screen also way way better previou iphon modelshighli secur mani use featur like ocr text photo one thempric high almost doubl iphon 13 probabl due complet importedoveral good phone budget,0.9844,positive
