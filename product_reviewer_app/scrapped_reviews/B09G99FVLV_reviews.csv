"Unfortunately, I couldn't buy this from Amazon as they didn't have stock. I had to buy it from Reliance Digital which doesn't even have a return policy while it unethically accepted pre booking. However, my experience and opinion is fairly given.One of the most hyped launch. This size doesn't fit all the use cases. It is mainly meant for reading, browsing, media consumption and gaming and is NOT meant for serious productivity applications due to the small screen estate.Pros:Excellent A15 Bionic chip. Fast and Efficient. However note that the CPU is throttled to A14 like performance while GPU is better. I am not a gamer or video editor so just doesn't bother me.Good form factor for portability if the size is meant for you.Sound is fine for its size not loud but stereo from top and bottom.WiFi and Bluetooth works well in range but I noticed the sound level is less when connected to Bluetooth headphones.Front camera good with centre stage function.Rear camera is again 12 MP, but I can't see much use to it in an iPad. Has a flash too which should benefit for some kind of document scanning etc or occasional photography.Just needs about 2 hrs for full charge 0 to 100.Cons:Screen has Jelly scroll in portrait mode. Right side of the screen moves faster than the left side creating a wave like motion of the content which is very very visible while scrolling web pages with text. Can cause nauseating feel. For pages with videos like in You tube you can clearly see the wobbling of the screen with each video dancing like a jelly to the next one at its side which is like disgusting and cheap feel. This is the major issue with this mini 6 display.The aspect ratio for this model is changed for 16:12 to odd 16:10.5 resulting in most apps not fitting well over the screen which means more grey bars.Further, due to higher 326 ppi text looks too small and size needs to be increased. Apps don't fit into the new aspect ratio for now atleast and there is almost always some grey bars that practically makes the small size increase to 8.3"" meaningless.If anyone can really IGNORE this screen flaw (I can't personally) the screen is decent and definitely not of great quality for its color reproduction or brightness.The next worse thing is the Battery life. With a small 5 percent increase in screen area and same battery capacity like the earlier model, you barely get 8 hrs of screen on time with WiFi video browsing indoors with display set to about 175 nits. They should have increased the battery capacity to 5500 mah instead of 5025 mah. My earlier model used to have close to 10 hrs screen on time. If you do gaming or use productivity apps or Apple pencil expect not more than 2 to 4 hrs of screen on time. Standby time is excellent though (A small concession).IpadOS 15 for Mini 6 is just a kind of nonsense. All the icons on the home screen are closely packed in small size with heavy padding space left empty on the sides. Not sure if Apple will rectify it for mini 6 anytime soon. They just applied what is meant for bigger Ipads to mini which doesn't go well.Storage of 64 GB is just not fair for today's use. There isn't any option for 128 GB.With the issues especially the display, followed by the paltry 64 GB storage and average battery life for a cost of 47K (640$) meant for a base model (Case, screen protector and Apple pencil will add upto another 15K) its just not worth it. You feel robbed of the pleasure due to the display performance issues even if price doesn't bother you. I personally can't recommend this product with above reasons at this price point. The hype is just not worth it.Note: Apple has no questions asked return policy for 14 days after receipt in the US and Europe. However, in India it is a 7 day period (starting from date of invoice) and that too only if Apple service centre can certify that the product is defective. However, the price is more than that they have for other markets. Another Joke from Apple for its Indian customers.

"I have been through android flagships and iphones and still have them around for travel purpose, because they have great cameras. But as my daily driver I use a potato Nokia as a phone and this beautiful, magnificent, efficient, compact yet powerful iteration of the iPad Mini lineup.
