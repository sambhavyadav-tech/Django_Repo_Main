No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.,India,30-December-2018,doubt great bass great extent nois cancel decent sound clariti mindblow batteri follow dissapoint though tri lot adjust1bluetooth rang 10m2 pain ear due conic budscan removed3 wire bit long make odd front4 pouch provided5 worst part low qualiti distor mic person keep complain voic,-0.9435,negative

"I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading.
