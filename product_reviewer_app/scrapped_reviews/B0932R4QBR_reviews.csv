"King of tablet!!(Bought 11 inch m1 ipad pro base variant. Reviewing after using 3 weeks)Pros-1. Aluminium build, narrow bezel, premium design.2. Quad speaker- sounds great.3. Unlike mini LED in 12.9 inch ipad pro- display pretty decent with liquid retina lcd 600 nits brightness supports HDR content.4. Single port- now supports thunderbolt, fast charging. With good quality usb type c hub you can do multitasking. Mirror screen to external display with type c to hdmi cable.5. New apple M1 chip with 8 gb ram gives high performance with great power efficiency. Battery last 1 days with moderate to heavy usage.6. Front facing camera now support wide view with center stage feature.7. 11 inch is a sweet spot because of its portability, Reading ebooks. While 12.9 inch is less portable but gives pleasant experience with content viewing.Cons1. Although Ipad has very strong hardware but its crippled by limited software functionality of ipados. Recent lauching of ipados15 in Apple WWDC didn't add most awaited feature like pro apps, external monitor support, mac like filesystem etc. Ipados has long way to go hence can't be a laptop replacement yet.2. Accessories (not included) like Apple pencil, magic keyboard are very expensive. But thank god apple has included charger and type c cable- thats very generous üçè3. Not IP rated, no wireless charging, no calling feature in 5g variant (even after paying 15k extra)!4. Fragile! Can't use without protective case.5. Buying just ipad is not enough- you have to buy accessories like apple pencil, magic keyboard, screen protector, well padded bag, usb c hub- which altogether cost nearly close to new m1 macbook pro!So think wisely before buying. Consider according to your necessity.Overall its the best tablet available in market.Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.",India,25-May-2021,king tabletbought 11 inch m1 ipad pro base variant review use 3 weekspros1 aluminium build narrow bezel premium design2 quad speaker sound great3 unlik mini led 129 inch ipad pro display pretti decent liquid retina lcd 600 nit bright support hdr content4 singl port support thunderbolt fast charg good qualiti usb type c hub multitask mirror screen extern display type c hdmi cable5 new appl m1 chip 8 gb ram give high perform great power effici batteri last 1 day moder heavi usage6 front face camera support wide view center stage feature7 11 inch sweet spot portabl read ebook 129 inch less portabl give pleasant experi content viewingcons1 although ipad strong hardwar crippl limit softwar function ipado recent lauch ipados15 appl wwdc didnt add await featur like pro app extern monitor support mac like filesystem etc ipado long way go henc cant laptop replac yet2 accessori includ like appl pencil magic keyboard expens thank god appl includ charger type c cabl that gener 3 ip rate wireless charg call featur 5g variant even pay 15k extra4 fragil cant use without protect case5 buy ipad enough buy accessori like appl pencil magic keyboard screen protector well pad bag usb c hub altogeth cost nearli close new m1 macbook proso think wise buy consid accord necessityoveral best tablet avail marketthank amazon prompt deliveri,0.9956,positive

"Points to be considered before selecting the correct variant for you:1. Avoid the 128Gb variant if you wanna use it for more than 2 years.2. Think twice before buying a Wi-Fi+ SIM variant. I bought it with 5G support but never put a sim as WiFi is enough for me. So I could have saved 10K.3. If budget is an issue and you just need it for taking notes and some entertainment then you can go for Air. Trust me, you won't regret that.4. Don't go for 12.9‚Äô‚Äô until you need it.

A great product to buy. Bought it with the magic keyboard and both work like a charm. The magic keyboard has a backlit thus we can easily use the iPad during hours of darkness.  Definitely not a replacement for a laptop but does almost all the work required for the day to day functioning.Had purchased the WiFi + Cellular version. But IMHO it‚Äôs better to go with just the WiFi version only as the cellular one doesn‚Äôt allow you to make a call but is there only for the data. The same can be done easily using the mobile hotspot.
