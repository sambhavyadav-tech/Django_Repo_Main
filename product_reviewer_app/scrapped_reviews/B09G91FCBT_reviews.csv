According to me guysFirst of all I haven't purchased iPhoneSecondly according to me if you have this much budget of more than 1lakhs spending on mobile is not worth at allInfact you can invest that money on apple stock or other  stock  so that the money could get doubled in future bcoz buying  iPhone is a depreciating assetHope you understand üôÇ,India,17-December-2021,accord guysfirst havent purchas iphonesecondli accord much budget 1lakh spend mobil worth allinfact invest money appl stock stock money could get doubl futur bcoz buy iphon depreci assethop understand ,0.2596,positive

I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can‚Äôt even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don‚Äôt need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it‚Äôs gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.,India,26-December-2021,start use iphon 5 seri sinc 7th iphon upgrad must say till date got best batteri observ previou iphon camera qualiti cant even think compar phone world definit dont need carri fslr video cam piec liter make profession movi camerath thing need shell hell lot money owner beauti end give satisfact noth els give bestmi suggest go capac,0.8047,positive
"Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It‚Äôs just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don‚Äôt feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it‚Äôs really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.",India,15-March-2022,switch android iphon pro conspros1 batteri life pro max excel android even 6000 mah beat well optimised2 camera guess one best best3 screen 120hz feel smooth differ experi android similar refresh dont feel smooth poorli optimisedcons1 price got 512gb pro max 155 lac valu amount money spend charger2 softwar wise notif realli bad android compil notif much better also realli tricki transfer whatsapp stuff android,0.7327,positive

"I was very skeptical about the genuineness of the product that I would receive as it was not available in stock in stores. So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand.
