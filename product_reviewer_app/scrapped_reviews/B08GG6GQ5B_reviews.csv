"This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".I would say it's perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you'd better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase.",India,7-October-2019,product review use straight 2 hour sinc got deliv todaywhat improv firstli boat basshead 225now dont know neg review sinc person find issu whatsoev infact delight itif look good wire earphon dont want spend much would best budget earphon market right nowfirstli speak bodi plastic metal becom lighter previou basshead much use 2 straight hour almost forgot put felt wire could bit thicker dont forget wire braid coat rubber like materi resolv dilemmathes come ear hook surpris comfort usual hate ear hook caus hurt soft fit right inmov main purpos bigger question bassi would say perfectth sound qualiti crisp clearbass right spot accord dont need anymorey may hear review bass good previou basshead pleas understand depend kind music listen mostli kbp kilo bit per second higher kbp better sound includ bass trebleth loud great almost deafen highest volumeto check nois cancel although earphon dont say nois cancel made phone call ask heard background nois said could hear littl noth what happen background ofcours normal environ may cancel traffic sound loud background noiseth ad advantag ipx4 sweat water resist dont find featur wire earphon atleast price rang great special work jog talk walk although sinc wire find discomfort may want get wireless bluetooth earphon insteadso here would rate scale 1 5 5 highest 1 lowestpric 5build qualiti 45 caus think wire could littl thickerloud 5call qualiti 5bass 5 bass perfect bass youd better put ear loudspeakerhop clarifi doubt productal yet anoth great product boat wont regret purchas,0.993,positive

"This is the true earphone to connect you to nirvana not for longer times because it starts pain in ear after a long time continuous use.Bass- in the price of 450, bass is terrible. You will get powerful bass than you expect.Sound- if a headphone has poor sound, it is not a headphone. But this one has the sound that will blow your mind totally.Noice cancellation- in the price range of 400-500 no brand will give you perfect noice cancellation headphones, but in boat bassheads, there is noice cancellation but not so good.Overall- if you have 500 rs.

"Just overdid it on the bass. There is virtually no treble. The singers voice just gets muted. Good for pew pew Hindi, pop, hip-hop type songs. I guess that's why they are sold in India.
