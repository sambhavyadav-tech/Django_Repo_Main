When we tried contacting Amazon for the replacement, they asked us to connect to apple and when connected to apple, they asked to connect with Amazon.

"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I canâ€™t believe what Iâ€™m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isnâ€™t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and Iâ€™m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I donâ€™t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.",India,25-September-2021,honest review go broke buy depreci objecti use android phone sinc last 10 year final decid switch iphon use roast iphon price lack featur also thing like power adapt given box etc last android phone iqoo 7 legend lot softwar relat issu batteri issu updat android 12 tire bug softwar glitch android final decid buy iphon switch android io boy righti never even held iphon life price made great choic even spend save itiphon 13 smooth even iqoo 7 legend 120hz feel slower even iphon 60hz cant believ im see gamesapp much smoother optimis androidi sceptic charg speed iphon iqoo 66w fast charger iphon buy 20w separ fast charger 1800r charg speed isnt disappointingdisplay qualiti truli flagship level im quit fan small 61 display believ abl reach top display one hand help build qualiti greati would recommend wast extra 40k buy 13 pro dont think extra camera telephoto len worth spend 40kyou see 3rd imag attach qualiti wide angl camera pic shot iphon 13 wide angl camera struggl low light main camera realli good captur true colour front camera realli good truli flagshipspeak greatbatteri life better previou devicesio optimis term batteri life easi 8hr sot normal usagenot play bgmi loos around 2 batteri everi 6minut hd extrem graphic also good pro max would far better term batteryfor softwar ye feel like downsid even softwar smooth less bug two annoy thing game get paus open control centr check batteri etc lock screen annoy also reach top left corner see notif also annoy clear notif also annoyingbut perfect 1010 purchas disappoint paid iphon receiv truli happi bought ittruli worth,0.9973,positive
