"I ordered ipad 10.2 (9thGen) and it came with one side seal not sticking properly, I realised you can easily open the box without disturbing the other side of the seal. However, I noticed right out of the box the display had burns, it definitely seemed a refurbished item because apple quality check is very stringent. However, same day amazon agreed to replace the device and ordered for hand to hand change the very next day.Here is the funny thing now:10th - Order picked up11th - Out for delivery (3 hrs later .. cannot deliver due to external factors)12th - Out for delivery (3 hrs later .. cannot deliver due to external factors)13th - Out for delivery (3 hrs later .. cannot delivery due to external factors)Post that I called the customer care and asked for explanation, they have no explanation and gave me vague answers. I had to go through three customer service reps before it came to conclusion to just wait for one day or else they will refund.I explicitly told them I do not need refund and to which they said they have no option as per their protocol.. Something fishy is happening here.Finally after a very rough call with Amazon (hope its recorded for evidence) my replacement ipad got delivered and the BEST PART..The seal is broken from one side…However, the ipad is running but I believe this seller is a cheat and the service from amazon was a piss poor job.Go for the store… Good Luck!",India,6-December-2021,order ipad 102 9thgen came one side seal stick properli realis easili open box without disturb side seal howev notic right box display burn definit seem refurbish item appl qualiti check stringent howev day amazon agre replac devic order hand hand chang next dayher funni thing now10th order pick up11th deliveri 3 hr later cannot deliv due extern factors12th deliveri 3 hr later cannot deliv due extern factors13th deliveri 3 hr later cannot deliveri due extern factorspost call custom care ask explan explan gave vagu answer go three custom servic rep came conclus wait one day els refundi explicitli told need refund said option per protocol someth fishi happen herefin rough call amazon hope record evid replac ipad got deliv best partth seal broken one sidehowev ipad run believ seller cheat servic amazon piss poor jobgo store good luck,0.8466,positive
"My order number is 403- 5292109-2610761, I received my iPad on 17th January. At first everything was fine but it's been 2, 3 days that it is taking too long for my iPad to get charged fully. If the battery percentage is 84%  then after 1 hour also it's stuck at 84%. I don't know whether the problem is with adapter or iPad. I feel like this should not be fine with a newly brought IPad. I request everyone to buy apple product from Apple store from any city. I am regretting my choice by buying it online. It was 84% after half an hour also it is stuck at 84%.

"For a couple of months I was damn skeptical about this iPad, I had mental fight whether I should go for iPad mini 6 or iPad 9th generation. And I wanted to buy higher storage variant but somehow I have to settle with 64gb variant and eventually bought this iPad 9th generation 64gb variant.Some of cons and pros are mentioned below-Pros-1. It's a beast when it comes to performance because of the powerful A13 bionic processor and no android tab can come near to this even below 50-60k.2. It has a great battery which lasts 1.5 days.3. This iPad is supported apple pencil 1st gen and the combination is buttery smooth.4. It also has 3.5 mm jack which no tab offers at this price category.5. A great 10.2 inch display which is very comfortable to hold and the screen size is just perfect.6. It has a crisp and clean speaker.7. It has a solid aluminium build and feels premium to hold.Cons-1. A biggest cons is lightening connector which is not as fast as type c.2. Display is non laminated but it's hard to notice with eyes.3. Speaker placement could have been better as it's only one-sided though it's a stereo speaker and your experience could be better by putting headphones.Conclusion: This is the best iPad at this price category. Go for it without any second thought. Samsung is lagging in so many things such as performance and display because they always offers TFT display which is worst at this price range.

"Came across quite a few reviews highlighting how Amazon’s (and other e-commerce platforms’) policy has changed for worse. Still went ahead and bought it from here. New ipad straight out of the box has a screen defect. Check pictures. Seal on one side was broken too. Wondering if they’re selling refurbished products or something.The ipad is great. Deep value for money. Bought the ipad air 2 in 2014 for a higher price and with inflation and all, you get the idea. This has better processor, better camera, Apple Pencil support among other things.Advice: Don’t bother with the 5-10% bank discount you get on these websites.

"For months I had this constant mental fight on whether buying a tablet or a laptop when I go to med school.Since I have planned to complete this year’s entrance exam coaching prep online, I had to buy something.The day after I took that decision, the new gen was available to order. So I didn’t think much more since I knew everything about this device from many resources. Honestly one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.Glad that I didn’t go for any other tablets around this price range. Battery lasts upto 3 days with my constant use for my studies. The iPadOS is running smooth with just a few bugs.Even though the design, accessories and port is pretty much outdated, I think it can run smoothly over my whole med school years as my secondary device.
