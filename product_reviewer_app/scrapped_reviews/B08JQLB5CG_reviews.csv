"Sound Quality is Impressive. Nothing to complain about.The carrying case can charge the earbuds upto  3 times to a full chargeI use a single earbud at a time, because I mostly use it for phone conversations.Perfect fit inside a helmet while riding a bike.But i do enjoy the stereo quality at times.Excellent price for triple nine.Better than expected.Finally a functional product that will use.Edit: Right Earbud stopped functioning after 2 months.

"I bought these in the great indian sale for ₹999TLDR;- Good sound and mic- Comfortable- Good quality- Decent battery life- Value for moneyFull review:- Firstly, the build quality. It feels sturdy and has magnets for the lid as well as the buds themselves. The case also has a satisfying click when closed :)- The buds are very lightweight and fit comfortably in the ears.- As soon as you pull out a bud from the case, it will get connected if you've paired with a device. As soon as you put it back in the case it'll disconnect. The magnet is strong and doesn't open when dropped :p- Sound quality is excellent for the price. If you connect with a device and the sound quality is bad or breaking, try closing any tabs/apps using the mic. Bluetooth headsets loose quality when mic is being used.- The percent displayed on the case is beautiful. Also very useful to know how much charge is left in the case. The charge left on the buds can be check on the paired device- The device works in mono or stereo, depending on how many buds are outside the case.- The box was sealed with shrinkwrap as well as two plastic seals, one on either sides.- There is one clickable button on each bud, which multifunctions as play/pause, accept calls, google assistant trugger, turn on/off, and reset settings- The mic quality is apparantly good as well, based on my conversation with a friend- With low to moderate usage these have lasted over 3 days now, with 100% on the buds and 20% on the case- BoAt also seems to have good after sales support.
