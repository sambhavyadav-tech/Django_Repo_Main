"Don’t hesitate. I repeat, don’t.!Compared to the Series 6 or last year’s Series 5, the main thing the SE lacks is an always-on display, which allows you to see the time or your notifications without having to tap the screen or lift your wrist up. For me, this is a must-have feature — I think a watch should always function as a watch and tell me the time without any extra work. But it’s not important for everybody, and it does consume more battery life.Pros : Workout Tracking. Proactive Health Monitor. Sleek Design. Large Display. Ability to Send and Receive Calls. Water Resistance. Cellular Connectivity. Storage Capacity.Cons : ECG monitor and Blood Oxygen, though I’m not a huge fan of those, hence it’s not a big deal for me.No need to go for Watch Series 6 if you are okay with those Cons, Go ahead and purchase this beauty and save some money..!!",India,4-October-2020,dont hesit repeat dontcompar seri 6 last year seri 5 main thing se lack alwayson display allow see time notif without tap screen lift wrist musthav featur think watch alway function watch tell time without extra work import everybodi consum batteri lifepro workout track proactiv health monitor sleek design larg display abil send receiv call water resist cellular connect storag capacitycon ecg monitor blood oxygen though im huge fan henc big deal meno need go watch seri 6 okay con go ahead purchas beauti save money,0.9442,positive
This is my first smart watch and i loved it! I would suggest to go for 44mm for gents! My wrist would have a size around 6inches and 40mm looks just perfect but anyone with bigger wrist would feel 40mm as too small.

"1. Battery is the worst. It dies even before a day.2. I get sms notifications which I have muted in my iPhone, I contacted apple care but they don’t know and don’t care.3. After 3 months, it stopped sending SMS, I contacted Apple care, they don't care. I visited apple service center, they don't care either.4. This is LTE version but you have to pay apple-music to listen to songs without your phone.5. There’s no practical use to this, only inbuilt apps are there which are of no use anyway.I don’t recommend this.6.

The watch delivered to me was defective. I was unable to attach one of the bands to the watch. The band didn’t lock in the centre it kept sliding from one side to the other. I have requested a return and refund which is yet to be processed. Amazon customer care has been responsive to the concern. However not happy with Apple.

Its a good watch for the price. If you are not finicky about always on feature and does not require ECG and Blood oxygen feature you can go for it and save money. One star less as got small scratch at bottom of screen within a week and i do not remember slamming hard anywhere. One expect a harder screen for watches which costs above 20k. Apple need to work on this. I do not see any other watch needing screen guard and cover to be saved from scratches :).
